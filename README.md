# Natural-Language-Understanding-System-for-African-Language
The following repository contains a Natural Language Understanding for African languages (NLU) project which is a solution which has been built for JP Morgan Chase, an American multinational investment banking and financial services holding company with their team (AI Research) dedicated to solving problems through research using artificial intelligence.   The objective of the project is to create open source NLU resources (datasets and models) for Swahili and Kinyarwanda for the research community.   In this project, we explore the English ATIS flight dataset to come up with equivalent datasets, slot labels and intents in Swahili and Kinyarwanda.  
This was achieved by
● Creating Translation pipelines for Swahili and Kinyarwanda.
● Creating open source ATIS flight dataset for Swahili and Kinyarwanda
● Developing deep learning models (BERT and mBERT) for performing NLU tasks and open sourcing them.
